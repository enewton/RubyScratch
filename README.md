# Scrit

Hi welcome to what is currently called Scrit, but will hopefully be renamed to something better if it becomes good. It is currently very early days, but the intention of this Ruby Gem is to provide a simple gaming framework which uses similar concepts & terms to MIT Scratch. The motivation behind this is to help beginners migrate from Scratch to another language.

A child's introduction to programming is often through Scratch and they rapidly start making brilliant games. As they start to outgrow Scratch and move to Python or Ruby, they are faced with a massive learning curve before they can get back to making games as good as with Scratch. Often boredom/frustration sets in before then.

This project is an experiment to see how simple I can make a gaming framework. The project is currently a thin layer on top of the Gosu library; but this could change in the future.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'scrit'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install scrit

## Usage

For now see the examples on the [Wiki](https://github.com/enewton/RubyScratch/wiki). Note: as it is very early days, the API will definitely change! I will try to keep the Wiki up to date.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
